# Automobile-Price-Prediction-System
A data-driven project that analyses and predicts automobile prices using Python, OOP, and machine learning. Includes data cleaning, EDA, visualisation, and model building with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to extract insights and forecast car prices accurately.

📖 Overview

The Automobile Price Prediction System is a data-driven project that analyses and predicts the selling price of cars based on multiple factors, including brand, mileage, fuel type, engine size, and horsepower.
Using Python, OOP concepts, and Machine Learning, this project helps uncover insights about pricing trends and customer preferences in the automobile market.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw automobile data.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.

Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modular and reusable code.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction.

Visualise key findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Derive insights to assist dealerships in strategic pricing and sales decisions.
